# EntWars
A strategy game made with entt and sfml

Made with the intent of learning how to use a modern ecs system while also making a kind of game I'm interested in

# Building
Make a directory called "build" and open a command window there. Then run CMake to generate the project of your choice. For example:

`cmake .. -G "Visual Studio 17 2022"`
